Project Objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical lifestyle attributes. Using a dataset that includes variables such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, heart disease status, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels, we apply machine learning techniques to accurately identify diabetes risk. The goal is to accurately identify diabetes risk. The goal is to support early detection and proactive healthcare decision-making through data-driven insights.
